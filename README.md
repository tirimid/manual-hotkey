# manual-hotkey
## Introduction
An AutoHotkey alternative for Linux with its own scripting language. Since AHK
doesn't exist for Linux (and I don't like any of the alternatives), I decided to
make my own interpretation of a programmable macro system.

## Build Requirements
* GCC
* GNU Make

## Contribution Guidelines
I will only accept pull requests if they contain features / fixes which I like.
In general, feel free to fork the repository and create your own version of
manual-hot-key. If you know me in person, feel free to contribute ideas.
